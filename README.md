4️⃣ First Steps in Development

💡 Step 1: Implement Fast Matrix Operations

    Why? Almost all ML models rely on matrix multiplications, so we optimize those first.
    How? Use SIMD (AVX, NEON) for fast dot products, matrix-vector multiplication, etc.

💡 Step 2: Implement Simple Model Inference

    Start with logistic regression & decision trees (easy & lightweight).
    Example: y = Wx + b (Matrix multiplication → Apply Activation Function).

💡 Step 3: Build Model Loading System

    Read tiny models in a binary format (so no huge frameworks like TensorFlow).
    Example: Store weights as a simple binary file (.mlx) and load it efficiently.

💡 Step 4: Benchmark & Optimize

    Run tests on Raspberry Pi, ESP32, low-power CPUs to measure speed & RAM usage.
    Optimize hot loops with SIMD intrinsics.
